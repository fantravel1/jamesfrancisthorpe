            <p>On February 6, 1904, sixteen-year-old Jim Thorpe arrived at the Carlisle Indian Industrial School in Pennsylvania—a 1,200-mile journey from his Oklahoma homeland. The institution he entered had a chilling motto: "Kill the Indian, save the man." Yet within this place designed to erase his Indigenous identity, Thorpe would discover his athletic destiny and become the most famous Native American in the world.</p>

            <h2>The School of Cultural Erasure</h2>

            <p>Founded in 1879 by Captain Richard Henry Pratt, Carlisle was the model for hundreds of Indian boarding schools across America. Its mission was explicit: forcibly assimilate Native American children into white American culture by destroying their connection to tribal traditions.</p>

            <p>Upon arrival, students faced immediate cultural violence:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Forced haircuts</strong> - Long hair, sacred in many Native cultures, was shaved off</li>
                <li><strong>Name changes</strong> - Students received "Christian" English names, erasing their birth names</li>
                <li><strong>English-only policy</strong> - Children were punished for speaking their native languages, sometimes having their mouths washed with lye soap</li>
                <li><strong>Military uniforms</strong> - Traditional clothing was confiscated and replaced with army-style dress</li>
                <li><strong>Christian indoctrination</strong> - Native spiritual practices were forbidden</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Jim Thorpe, whose Sac and Fox name Wa-Tho-Huk meant "Bright Path," was forced into this system while still grieving his mother's death and his twin brother's loss years earlier. The school's goal was to make him forget he was Native American. Instead, it would make him unforgettable.</p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h3>President Biden's 2024 Designation</h3>
                <p>On December 9, 2024, President Joe Biden designated the Carlisle Indian Industrial School site as a national monument, recognizing it as a symbol of the federal government's systematic attempt to erase Indigenous cultures. The designation acknowledges both the trauma inflicted and the resilience of the students who survived it—including Jim Thorpe.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>The Legendary High Jump Discovery</h2>

            <p>For his first three years at Carlisle, Thorpe worked in the school's tailor shop and played intramural sports, his extraordinary athletic gifts undiscovered. The institution saw him as just another Indian boy to be "civilized."</p>

            <p>Then came the spring day in 1907 that changed everything.</p>

            <p>Walking past the track field in his work overalls and dress shirt, Thorpe noticed upperclassmen practicing the high jump. The bar was set at 5 feet, 9 inches—taller than Thorpe's own 5'8" frame. On a whim, he asked if he could try. The athletes, amused, handed him a pair of track shoes.</p>

            <p>Thorpe easily cleared the bar. Multiple times.</p>

            <p>He had just broken the school record, in street clothes, without any training.</p>

            <blockquote>
                "Have I done anything wrong?"<br>
                Thorpe asked when summoned by Coach Glenn "Pop" Warner the next morning.<br><br>
                "Son, you've only broken the school record. That's all."
            </blockquote>

            <h2>Pop Warner and the Birth of a Legend</h2>

            <p>Glenn Scobey "Pop" Warner, hired as Carlisle's athletic director in 1899, was one of football's great innovators. But he'd never seen an athlete like Jim Thorpe.</p>

            <p>Warner initially tested Thorpe on the football field by having the varsity defense try to tackle him. Thorpe, with no formal football training, ran through the entire team twice. When Warner blew the whistle, Thorpe walked over and delivered his famous line:</p>

            <blockquote>
                "Nobody is going to tackle Jim."
            </blockquote>

            <p>It became Warner's mission to showcase this remarkable athlete—though historians debate whether he was more interested in Thorpe's welfare or in what Thorpe could do for Carlisle's reputation and Warner's own career.</p>

            <h2>Football Revolution at Carlisle</h2>

            <p>Under Warner's coaching, Carlisle became "the team that invented football." They developed:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>The overhand spiral pass</li>
                <li>The handoff fake</li>
                <li>Innovative trick plays including the "hidden ball" play</li>
                <li>The single wing and double wing formations</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Thorpe was the perfect weapon for Warner's innovations. Playing running back, defensive back, placekicker, and punter, he could do everything on the field.</p>

            <h3>The 1911 Harvard Upset</h3>

            <p>On November 4, 1911, Carlisle traveled to Cambridge to face mighty Harvard. Thorpe scored all 18 of Carlisle's points in an 18-15 upset:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Four field goals (some accounts say he kicked them with an injured ankle)</li>
                <li>173 yards rushing</li>
                <li>Multiple punts that pinned Harvard deep in their territory</li>
            </ul>

            <p>An obscure Indian boarding school had defeated one of America's elite institutions. The symbolism wasn't lost on anyone.</p>

            <h3>The 1912 Army Game</h3>

            <p>On November 9, 1912—just 22 years after the Wounded Knee Massacre—Carlisle faced Army at West Point. Warner's pre-game speech invoked this history:</p>

            <blockquote>
                "Your fathers and grandfathers fought their fathers. These men are soldiers. They are the Long Knives. You are Indians. Go ahead and fight them."
            </blockquote>

            <p>Thorpe dominated. He had a 92-yard touchdown run called back for penalty, then scored on a 97-yard touchdown on the very next play. Carlisle won 27-6. A young cadet named Dwight D. Eisenhower, tasked with stopping Thorpe, later said:</p>

            <blockquote>
                "He never practiced in his life, and he could do anything better than any other football player I ever saw."
            </blockquote>

            <h2>The Carlisle Paradox</h2>

            <p>Jim Thorpe's success at Carlisle represents one of history's great ironies. The school existed to destroy Native identity, yet Thorpe's achievements there made him the most visible Native American in the world. Warner and Carlisle administrators exploited his talent for the school's glory, but in doing so, they inadvertently created a platform that would showcase Indigenous excellence.</p>

            <p>Thorpe never forgot who he was. Even as Carlisle tried to strip away Wa-Tho-Huk, Jim Thorpe held onto his identity. His athletic dominance became an act of survival and resistance.</p>

            <h2>The Path to Stockholm</h2>

            <p>Thorpe attended Carlisle from February 6, 1904, to June 14, 1909, then returned September 1911 to February 1, 1913. During these years, he compiled a record that has never been matched:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Led Carlisle to a 23-2-1 football record from 1911-1912</li>
                <li>Scored 224 points in 1912 (leading the nation)</li>
                <li>Won multiple track and field events</li>
                <li>Became the face of Carlisle athletics</li>
            </ul>

            <p>His performance caught the attention of Olympic selectors. In 1912, Thorpe would travel to Stockholm, Sweden, representing the United States—a nation that wouldn't grant him citizenship for another 12 years—and become a global icon.</p>

            <p>But he would always be a Carlisle Indian. The school's attempt to "kill the Indian" had instead given the world its greatest athlete. And Jim Thorpe, who arrived as a grieving teenager trying to survive an assimilation machine, left as Wa-Tho-Huk—the Bright Path that would light the way for generations of Indigenous athletes to come.</p>
