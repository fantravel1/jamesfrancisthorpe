        <div>
            <p>Baseball was Jim Thorpe's first love in sports. Long before he became an Olympic champion or football legend, young Jim played baseball on the Sac and Fox reservation in Oklahoma, using handmade equipment and dreaming of the Major Leagues.</p>

            <p>That dream came true on February 1, 1913, when Thorpe signed a three-year, $18,000 contract with the New York Giants. But the reality of professional baseball would prove far more complex and challenging than the Olympic track where he had dominated so completely.</p>

            <p>This is the story of Jim Thorpe's six-year Major League career—a journey marked by steady improvement, legendary moments, difficult relationships, and the persistent question of what might have been.</p>

            <h2>The Rocky Mount Years (1909-1910)</h2>

            <p>Before Thorpe's Olympic glory, before the gold medals and King Gustav's famous declaration, he spent two summers playing semi-professional baseball in North Carolina.</p>

            <p>In 1909 and 1910, during his breaks from Carlisle Indian Industrial School, Thorpe played for the Rocky Mount Railroaders in the Class D Eastern Carolina League. He was primarily a pitcher, posting a 9-10 record in 1909 and 10-10 in 1910.</p>

            <p>The pay was modest—reports vary from as little as $2 per game to as much as $35 per week. It was pocket money for a college student, nothing more. But those few dollars would cost Thorpe dearly.</p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h3>The $60 That Changed History</h3>
                <p>The money Thorpe earned in Rocky Mount—an estimated total of around $60 over two summers—would lead to his Olympic medals being stripped in January 1913. Unlike many white athletes who also played for pay under assumed names, Thorpe had used his real name, making his "violation" of amateur rules easy to discover.</p>
                <p>Ironically, this scandal opened the door to his professional baseball career, as he was no longer bound by amateur restrictions.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>John McGraw and the New York Giants</h2>

            <p>Less than a month after losing his Olympic medals, Jim Thorpe signed with the New York Giants. The contract was negotiated by legendary manager John McGraw, one of the most successful and demanding figures in baseball history.</p>

            <p>For Thorpe, it was a dream come true. Baseball was his favorite sport, and the Giants were one of the premier teams in the National League. The contract—three years for $18,000—made him one of the better-paid players on the roster.</p>

            <p>But McGraw's motivations were mixed. Yes, Thorpe had shown some ability in the minor leagues. But McGraw also saw Thorpe as a publicity draw—the famous Olympic athlete would put fans in seats whether he performed well or not.</p>

            <p>This tension between Thorpe as player and Thorpe as drawing card would define his relationship with McGraw and the Giants.</p>

            <h2>The Difficult Rookie Season (1913)</h2>

            <p>Thorpe's first season with the Giants was humbling. He appeared in just 19 games and hit a meager .143 with only one extra-base hit. He spent most of his time on the bench, watching as the Giants competed for the National League pennant.</p>

            <p>The problem wasn't just Thorpe's inexperience—it was the clash of personalities between the easygoing Native American athlete and the hard-driving, temperamental McGraw.</p>

            <p>McGraw was known for his tough management style, his strategic brilliance, and his willingness to berate players publicly. Thorpe, accustomed to the respect he'd earned in football and track, chafed under McGraw's harsh criticism.</p>

            <blockquote>
                "McGraw never gave me a real chance. He wanted me for publicity, not for playing."
                <br>— Jim Thorpe, reflecting on his Giants years
            </blockquote>

            <h2>Steady Improvement (1914-1915)</h2>

            <p>Despite the difficult start, Thorpe showed steady improvement in his second and third seasons with the Giants. He hit .194 in 1914 and .231 in 1915, gradually becoming more comfortable at the Major League level.</p>

            <p>When Thorpe did get playing time—particularly when McGraw was absent or when he was loaned to other teams—he demonstrated real ability. He had good speed, a strong arm, and natural instincts. The question was whether he would ever get enough consistent at-bats to fully develop those skills.</p>

            <h2>Milwaukee and the Minors (1916)</h2>

            <p>In 1916, frustrated with his lack of playing time, Thorpe left the Giants to play for the Milwaukee Brewers in the minor leagues. Away from McGraw's demanding presence, Thorpe flourished, hitting well and enjoying the game again.</p>

            <p>The Milwaukee stint proved what many had suspected: Thorpe performed better when he was playing regularly and wasn't under McGraw's critical eye.</p>

            <h2>The Cincinnati Stint and Return to New York (1917)</h2>

            <p>Thorpe returned to the Giants in 1917, hitting .237 in limited action. Early in the season, he was sold to the Cincinnati Reds, where he immediately began playing better. Later that same year, the Giants bought him back.</p>

            <p>It was during this season that Thorpe participated in one of baseball's most famous games: the "double no-hitter" between Fred Toney of the Reds and Hippo Vaughn of the Chicago Cubs. After nine innings of hitless baseball from both pitchers, the Reds broke through in the 10th inning.</p>

            <p>Jim Thorpe drove in the winning run.</p>

            <h2>Continued Growth (1918)</h2>

            <p>In 1918, Thorpe continued his gradual improvement, hitting .248 for the Giants. He was 30 years old and finally seemed to be putting it all together. The raw athletic talent that made him an Olympic champion was being refined into genuine baseball skill.</p>

            <p>But his relationship with John McGraw remained strained.</p>

            <h2>The Breaking Point and the "Dumb Indian" Incident (1919)</h2>

            <p>The final chapter of Jim Thorpe's relationship with the New York Giants came in 1919, and it ended ugly.</p>

            <p>During a game, Thorpe missed a signal from McGraw—a routine mistake that ballplayers make constantly. But McGraw, in front of teammates and spectators, allegedly shouted at Thorpe and called him a "dumb Indian."</p>

            <p>Thorpe, who had endured years of casual racism and condescension, had had enough. His pride got the better of him, and he went after McGraw. Teammates separated them before it came to blows, but the relationship was over.</p>

            <p>On May 21, 1919, Thorpe was traded to the Boston Braves for pitcher Pat Ragan.</p>

            <h2>The Best for Last: Boston 1919</h2>

            <p>Away from McGraw and finally getting regular playing time, Jim Thorpe had the best season of his baseball career with the Boston Braves in 1919.</p>

            <p>He hit .327—the best batting average on the entire Braves roster that year. At age 31, in his final season of professional baseball, Thorpe proved what he might have accomplished with consistent opportunity and better circumstances.</p>

            <p>The .327 average represented a remarkable progression from the .143 he'd hit as a rookie six years earlier. It was proof that Thorpe wasn't just a publicity stunt—he was a legitimate Major League ballplayer who had steadily improved every season he played.</p>

            <h2>What Might Have Been</h2>

            <p>Jim Thorpe's baseball career will always be defined by the word "potential." He showed steady improvement every season, culminating in that .327 final year. He demonstrated speed, power, and baseball instincts. And he did it all while playing sporadically, bouncing between teams, and dealing with a manager who viewed him as much as a gate attraction as a legitimate player.</p>

            <p>What might Thorpe have accomplished with 500 at-bats per season instead of sporadic playing time? What if he'd played for a manager who believed in him and developed his skills rather than using him for publicity? What if he'd focused exclusively on baseball instead of simultaneously pursuing professional football?</p>

            <p>We'll never know. But that .327 batting average in 1919 offers a tantalizing glimpse of what could have been.</p>

            <h2>The Legacy in Baseball</h2>

            <p>Jim Thorpe is not remembered primarily as a baseball player. His Olympic achievements and football dominance overshadow his six years in the Major Leagues. And his career statistics—.252 average, 82 RBI in 289 games—don't compare to baseball's greatest legends.</p>

            <p>But Thorpe's baseball career is significant nonetheless. He was one of the first Native American athletes to play in the Major Leagues at a high level. He proved that Olympic champions could transition to professional team sports. And he demonstrated remarkable perseverance and improvement in the face of difficult circumstances.</p>

            <p>Perhaps most importantly, Thorpe's baseball career showed his love for the game. Despite the frustration, despite the racism, despite being underutilized and underappreciated, he kept playing. Because for Jim Thorpe, baseball wasn't just a job or a paycheck—it was the sport he loved first and best.</p>

            <blockquote>
                "I'd rather play baseball than do anything else in the world."
                <br>— Jim Thorpe
            </blockquote>

            <p>After leaving baseball in 1919, Thorpe focused on professional football, where he became the first president of what would become the NFL. But he never forgot his time in baseball, and he never stopped loving the game that gave him his first professional sports opportunity.</p>

            <p>In the end, Jim Thorpe may not be in the Baseball Hall of Fame. But his story—from the sandlots of Oklahoma to Rocky Mount to the Polo Grounds—remains an important chapter in both baseball history and the story of the greatest athlete who ever lived.</p>
