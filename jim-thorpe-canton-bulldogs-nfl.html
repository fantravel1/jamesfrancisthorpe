    <article class="article-content">
        <div>
            <p>In 1915, Canton Bulldogs general manager Jack Cusack made a decision that would change professional football forever. He signed Jim Thorpe—Olympic champion, college football legend, and the most famous athlete in America—for the astronomical sum of $250 per game.</p>

            <p>It was the beginning of a partnership that would elevate professional football from a regional curiosity to a legitimate national sport, culminate in the founding of what would become the NFL, and cement Thorpe's legacy as not just a player, but a pioneer who shaped the future of American football.</p>

            <h2>The State of Professional Football in 1915</h2>

            <p>When Jim Thorpe entered professional football in 1915, the sport existed in a kind of sporting netherworld. It was popular in certain regions—particularly Ohio and western Pennsylvania—but was generally considered inferior to college football.</p>

            <p>Professional teams were loosely organized, rosters were fluid, and players regularly jumped from team to team based on whoever offered the most money. Games were played in small stadiums and open fields. Most players earned modest wages and held other jobs during the week.</p>

            <p>The sport needed legitimacy. It needed star power. It needed Jim Thorpe.</p>

            <h2>The $250 Per Game Gamble</h2>

            <p>Jack Cusack's offer to Jim Thorpe wasn't just generous—it was unprecedented. At $250 per game, Thorpe would earn more than most Americans made in a month. For context, the average annual income in 1915 was around $600-700.</p>

            <p>But Cusack understood that Thorpe was more than a football player. He was a draw. He was a name that sold tickets. And Cusack's gamble paid off immediately.</p>

                </div>
            </div>

            <h2>Thorpe's Debut: The Massillon Game</h2>

            <p>Jim Thorpe's professional football debut came against the Massillon Tigers, Canton's fiercest rival. Before Thorpe's arrival, Canton Bulldogs games typically drew around 1,200 spectators.</p>

            <p>For Thorpe's first game, 8,000 people showed up.</p>

            <p>The crowd wasn't disappointed. Thorpe dominated on both sides of the ball—running, passing, tackling, punting, and place-kicking. His versatility was unlike anything professional football had seen. He could do everything, and he did it better than anyone else.</p>

            <blockquote>
                "Thorpe was the greatest football player I ever saw. He could do everything: run, pass, kick, and tackle. He was also the smartest player I ever coached."
                <br>— Glenn "Pop" Warner
            </blockquote>

            <h2>The Canton Dynasty (1916-1919)</h2>

            <p>With Thorpe as their star player and de facto coach, the Canton Bulldogs dominated professional football. They claimed unofficial world championships in 1916, 1917, and 1919 (the 1918 season was abbreviated due to World War I and the Spanish Flu pandemic).</p>

            <h3>The 1919 Championship Season</h3>

            <p>The 1919 season showcased Thorpe at his best. In one particularly memorable championship game, with Canton backed up to its own 5-yard line and facing a strong wind, Thorpe delivered one of the most legendary punts in football history.</p>

            <p>With the wind at his back, Thorpe boomed a punt that traveled 95 yards in the air before landing. The kick completely flipped field position and effectively put the game out of reach. It was the kind of moment that seemed to confirm Thorpe's almost mythical athletic abilities.</p>

            <h2>The Hupmobile Meeting: September 17, 1920</h2>

            <p>By 1920, professional football had grown beyond its regional roots, but it still lacked organization. Teams competed under different rules. Player contracts were meaningless. Salary bidding wars threatened to bankrupt owners. Something had to change.</p>

            <p>On September 17, 1920, representatives from eleven football teams gathered at Ralph Hay's Hupmobile automobile dealership in Canton, Ohio. They came together to form a new league: the American Professional Football Association (APFA).</p>

            <div class="highlight-box">

                </ul>
            </div>

            <p>The goals of the APFA were clear:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Standardize rules across all teams</li>
                <li>Stop players from jumping between teams mid-season</li>
                <li>Combat escalating salary demands</li>
                <li>Protect college players' eligibility</li>
                <li>Give professional football legitimacy and structure</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The meeting at Hay's showroom was crowded—there weren't enough chairs, so some owners sat on the running boards of the Hupmobile cars while they conducted business.</p>

            <h2>Thorpe Elected First President</h2>

            <p>When it came time to elect a president for the new league, the choice was unanimous: Jim Thorpe.</p>

            <p>Thorpe's selection was both strategic and symbolic. He wasn't chosen for his administrative skills or business acumen. He was chosen because he was the most famous football player in America. His name commanded respect. His presence lent legitimacy.</p>

            <p>The owners understood that if they wanted professional football to be taken seriously, they needed a figurehead who embodied athletic excellence and star power. Jim Thorpe was that man.</p>

            <h2>Thorpe as APFA President (1920-1921)</h2>

            <p>Jim Thorpe's tenure as APFA president was brief and largely ceremonial. He served from 1920 to 1921, during which time he continued to play professional football for Canton and other teams.</p>

            <p>The actual administrative work was handled by others, particularly Joseph Carr, who succeeded Thorpe as president in 1921 and proved to be the organizational genius the league needed. Carr standardized scheduling, enforced rules, and gradually built the NFL into a sustainable business.</p>

            <p>But Thorpe's contribution shouldn't be minimized. His name and reputation gave the fledgling league credibility during its most vulnerable early years. When newspapers covered the APFA, they mentioned Jim Thorpe. When fans discussed professional football, they talked about Jim Thorpe. He was the league's first and most important ambassador.</p>

            <h2>Canton: The Birthplace of the NFL</h2>

            <p>The decision to hold that founding meeting in Canton wasn't arbitrary. Canton was the heart of professional football in 1920, and Jim Thorpe was the reason why.</p>

            <p>Today, Canton, Ohio, is home to the Pro Football Hall of Fame, a testament to the city's role in the sport's history. And Jim Thorpe was part of the Hall of Fame's very first class of inductees in 1963, ten years after his death.</p>

            <p>The Hall of Fame's location in Canton is a direct legacy of Thorpe's impact on the city and the sport. Where Jim Thorpe played, professional football thrived. Where professional football thrived, the NFL was born.</p>

            <h2>The Legacy of Thorpe's Professional Career</h2>

            <p>Jim Thorpe played professional football until 1928, competing well into his 40s. He played for multiple teams, including the Canton Bulldogs, Cleveland Indians, Oorang Indians (a team he founded consisting entirely of Native American players), Rock Island Independents, New York Giants, and Chicago Cardinals.</p>

            <p>His statistics from that era are incomplete—record-keeping was haphazard and many game details were lost to history. But the impact he had on the sport is undeniable.</p>

            <p>Thorpe proved that professional football could attract elite talent. He proved that stars could draw crowds and generate revenue. He proved that the professional game, with the right players and organization, could rival college football in excitement and skill.</p>

            <blockquote>
                "Jim Thorpe was the single most important person in the early history of professional football. Without him, there might not have been an NFL."
                <br>— Pro Football Hall of Fame historian
            </blockquote>

            <h2>From APFA to NFL to America's Sport</h2>

            <p>The American Professional Football Association officially became the National Football League in 1922. It would take decades for the NFL to achieve the popularity and cultural dominance it enjoys today, but the foundation was laid in that Hupmobile showroom in Canton in 1920.</p>

            <p>And at the center of that foundation was Jim Thorpe—Olympic champion, Canton Bulldogs star, and the first president of what would become America's most popular professional sports league.</p>

            <p>When people today watch an NFL game, they're watching the descendant of the league that Jim Thorpe helped create. When players compete for championships, they're continuing a tradition that Thorpe established in Canton over a century ago.</p>

            <p>His jersey number may not hang in every stadium, but his influence is everywhere. He was professional football's first superstar, its first ambassador, and its first president. He was, in every sense, a founding father of the NFL.</p>
